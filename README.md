# FPGA-7segment-display
FPGA chip used – Cyclone III EP3C16F484C6(N) <br>
Short FPGA project I've done using Quartus 13.1 Web Edition software. <br>
To test out this project you enter a 4-bit binary value using SW3-SW0. <br>
Value on 7-segment display will be a number from 0-9, or E if you've entered values larger than 9 and less or equal to 15. <br>
This combinational circuit was projected using Karnaugh's maps and disjunctive normal form, it could also be made by using conjuctive normal form. <br>
